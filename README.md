# android_flutter_template

A skeleton with Getx for android

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application with Getx state management.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Assets

The `assets` directory houses images, fonts, and any other files you want to
include with your application.

The `assets/images` directory contains [resolution-aware
images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

## Why?

I created this to make it simpler for me to create apps with my preferred architecture and structure.
